                <h2>Glastonbury Festival</h2>
                <p>
                    Glastonbury Festival (formally Glastonbury Festival of Contemporary Performing Arts and known
                    colloquially as Glastonbury) is a five-day festival of contemporary performing arts held near
                    Pilton, Somerset, England, in most summers. In addition to contemporary music, the festival hosts
                    dance, comedy, theatre, circus, cabaret, and other arts. Leading pop and rock artists have
                    headlined, alongside thousands of others appearing on smaller stages and performance areas. Films
                    and albums have been recorded at the festival, and it receives extensive television and newspaper
                    coverage.
                    <br><br>
                    Glastonbury is attended by around 200,000 people, requiring extensive security, transport, water,
                    and electricity-supply infrastructure. While the number of attendees is sometimes swollen by
                    gatecrashers, a record of 300,000 people was set at the 1994 festival, headlined by the Levellers,
                    who performed on The Pyramid Stage. Most festival staff are unpaid volunteers, helping the
                    festival to raise millions of pounds for charity organisations.
                    <br><br>
                    Regarded as a major event in British culture, the festival is inspired by the ethos of the hippie,
                    the counterculture of the 1960s, and the free festival movement. Vestiges of these traditions are
                    retained in the Green Fields area, which includes sections known as the Green Futures, the Stone
                    Circle and Healing Field. Michael Eavis hosted the first festival, then called Pilton Festival,
                    after seeing an open-air Led Zeppelin concert in 1970 at the Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive
                    Music.
                    <br><br>
                    The festival was held intermittently from 1970 until 1981 and has been held most years since, except
                    for "fallow years" taken mostly at five-year intervals, intended to give the land, local population,
                    and organisers a break. 2018 was a "fallow year", and the 2019 festival took place from 26 to 30
                    June. There have been two consecutive "fallow years" since then due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
                    The festival returned for 22-26 June 2022 with the headliners Billie Eilish, Paul McCartney and
                    Kendrick Lamar. The next festival took place between 21 and 25 June 2023, headlined by Arctic
                    Monkeys, Guns N' Roses and Elton John in his final UK performance.

                <h2>Glastonbury Location</h2>
                <p>
                    The festival takes place in South West England at Worthy Farm between the small villages of Pilton
                    and Pylle in Somerset, six miles east of Glastonbury, overlooked by the Glastonbury Tor in the "Vale
                    of Avalon". The area has a number of legends and spiritual traditions, and is a "New Age" site of
                    interest: ley lines are considered to converge on the Tor. The nearest town to the festival site is
                    Shepton Mallet, three miles (5 km) northeast, but there continues to be interaction between the
                    people espousing alternative lifestyles living in Glastonbury and the festival. The farm is situated
                    between the A361 and A37 roads.
                    <br><br>
                    Worthy Farm is situated at grid reference ST 590 397 in a valley at the head of the Whitelake River,
                    between two low limestone ridges, part of the southern edge of the Mendip Hills. On the site is a
                    confluence of the two small streams that make the Whitelake River. In the past, the site has
                    experienced problems with flooding, though after the floods that occurred during the 1997 and 1998
                    festival, drainage was improved. This did not prevent flooding during the 2005 festival, but allowed
                    the flood water to dissipate within hours. The Highbridge branch of the Somerset and Dorset Joint
                    Railway ran through the farm on an embankment but was dismantled in 1966 and now forms a main
                    thoroughfare across the site. Another prominent feature is the high-voltage electricity line which
                    crosses the site east-west. There are several public rights of way bordering the festival site.
                    <br><br>
                    In recent years, the site has been organised around a restricted backstage compound, with the
                    Pyramid stage on the north and Other stage on the south of the compound. Attractions on the east of
                    the site include the acoustic tent, comedy tent and circus. To the south are the green fields, which
                    include displays of traditional and environmentally friendly crafts. In King's Meadow, the hill at
                    the far south of the site, is a modern small megalith circle which, like Stonehenge, is coordinated
                    with the summer solstice, and since 1990 represents a stone circle.

                        <p>2023 saw Glastonbury return, firing on all cylinders. Joining the Green Fields, which have
                            always been powered by renewable energy, this year every generator across the Festival site
                            was run entirely on palm-oil free, sustainable HVO renewable fuel. This, along with the new
                            temporary wind turbine powering the food stalls at Carhenge, added to the Festival's
                            existing green energy arsenal - the solar array on the cowshed roof and the anaerobic
                            digester, turning slurry waste into renewable energy - helping to make Glastonbury a greener
                            and even more sustainable Festival.
