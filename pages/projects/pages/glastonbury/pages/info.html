                <p class="info-p">
                    Glastonbury Festival (formally Glastonbury Festival of Contemporary Performing Arts and known
                    colloquially as Glastonbury) is a five-day festival of contemporary performing arts held near
                    Pilton, Somerset, England, in most summers. In addition to contemporary music, the festival hosts
                    dance, comedy, theatre, circus, cabaret, and other arts. Leading pop and rock artists have
                    headlined, alongside thousands of others appearing on smaller stages and performance areas. Films
                    and albums have been recorded at the festival, and it receives extensive television and newspaper
                    coverage.
                    <br><br>
                    Glastonbury is attended by around 200,000 people, requiring extensive security, transport, water,
                    and electricity-supply infrastructure. While the number of attendees is sometimes swollen by
                    gatecrashers, a record of 300,000 people was set at the 1994 festival, headlined by the Levellers,
                    who performed on The Pyramid Stage. Most festival staff are unpaid volunteers, helping the
                    festival to raise millions of pounds for charity organizations.
                    <br><br>
                    Regarded as a major event in British culture, the festival is inspired by the ethos of the hippie,
                    the counterculture of the 1960s, and the free festival movement. Vestiges of these traditions are
                    retained in the Green Fields area, which includes sections known as the Green Futures, the Stone
                    Circle and Healing Field. Michael Eavis hosted the first festival, then called Pilton Festival,
                    after seeing an open-air Led Zeppelin concert in 1970 at the Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive
                    Music.
                    <br><br>
                    The festival was held intermittently from 1970 until 1981 and has been held most years since, except
                    for "fallow years" taken mostly at five-year intervals, intended to give the land, local population,
                    and organisers a break. 2018 was a "fallow year", and the 2019 festival took place from 26 to 30
                    June. There have been two consecutive "fallow years" since then due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
                    The festival returned for 22-26 June 2022 with the headliners Billie Eilish, Paul McCartney and
                    Kendrick Lamar. The next festival took place between 21 and 25 June 2023, headlined by Arctic
                    Monkeys, Guns N' Roses and Elton John in his final UK performance.

                <p class="info-p">
                    As part of the Festival‚Äôs initiative to encourage Festival goers to reduce audience transport
                    emissions, deposits for combined ticket + coach travel options went on sale at 6pm GMT on Thursday
                    16th November 2023, giving the opportunity to book tickets + coach travel ahead of the general
                    release of tickets.
                    <br><br>
                    A list of towns and cities covered by the ticket + coach travel option, and the cost of travel from
                    each departure point, can be found below.
                    <br><br>
                    To book in the ticket + coach travel sale you needed the registration number and registered postcode
                    for each person (up to 6 per transaction) for whom you are booking. You were also asked to choose a
                    Coach Departure Town and Coach Departure Day (Wednesday or Thursday). Please note you must have
                    chosen one option for your group as a whole ‚Äì you cannot select multiple options within one
                    transaction.
                    <br><br>
                    Ticket balances for ticket + coach travel bookings were due in the balance payment window, between
                    the 1st and 7th April 2024.
                    <br><br>
                    You must not book in the ticket + coach travel sale unless you are certain you will be able to
                    travel on the coach you have selected, as travel on your chosen coach is mandatory in order to
                    receive your Festival tickets.
                    <br><br>
                    If you are travelling with children aged 12 and under, who do not require an entry ticket for the
                    Festival, you will need to book these additional coach seats whilst making your ticket + coach
                    travel booking. If the additional seats required are not available when booking, please contact <a
                        style="color: greenyellow;"
                        href="mailto:coachtravel@seetickets.com">coachtravel@seetickets.com</a> upon completing your
                    booking in order to enquire about purchasing additional coach seats (NB: standard fares apply).

                <h2>GLASTONBURY REGISTRATION</h2>
                <p class="info-p">
                    To prevent touting, tickets for Glastonbury Festival are non-transferable. Each ticket features the
                    photograph of the registered ticket holder with security checks carried out to ensure that only the
                    person in the photograph is admitted to the Festival.
                    <br><br>
                    Whether you are booking a deposit for a Festival ticket or a ticket + coach travel option, every
                    person (aged 13 or over) who intends to purchase a ticket must have their own valid registration
                    number.
                    <br><br>
                    If you plan to buy tickets for other people, they all need to be registered ‚Äì and you will need
                    their registration numbers and corresponding postcodes in order to purchase tickets on their behalf.
                    <br><br>
                    Resale of tickets is strictly prohibited and will result in the cancellation of your order.
                    Online registration is free of charge and only takes a few minutes. We recommend completing your
                    registration well in advance of attempting to book tickets, as registration usually closes for
                    several weeks around each ticket sale, and you will need to allow time to re-submit your
                    registration if you need to. Once registration closes there will be no opportunity to
                    submit/re-submit a registration until after the ticket sales.
                    <br><br>
                    You will need to provide basic contact details and to upload a passport-standard photo.
                    <br><br>
                    Having entered your email address you will be sent a unique link within an hour which will allow you
                    to start the registration process. Please do check your junk/spam inboxes!
                    <br><br>
                    If you are hoping to register more than one person on a single email address, the link can be used
                    multiple times but you will need to wait 10 minutes between submitting each registration.
                    <br><br>
                    Registration will be temporarily suspended before and during the main ticket sales periods so please
                    allow time for your photo to be approved.
                    <br><br>
                    Registration will close at 5pm on Monday 13th November, after which there will be no opportunity to
                    submit/re-submit a registration until after the November ticket sales.
                    <br><br>
                    Please ensure all your details are correct, and that your photo is in jpeg format, of a suitable
                    size (min 900 pixels wide x 1350 pixels tall), of portrait orientation and passport standard before
                    submitting your details.
                    <br><br>
                    Once you have submitted your photo, you will receive an automated email confirming receipt of your
                    data, followed by a second email within 48 hours in the working week, either accepting or rejecting
                    your photo, and if successful, confirming your registration number. If you have not received a
                    confirmation email within 48 hours (Monday-Friday) of making an online application, please check
                    your spam folder. If your registration is rejected or you do not receive a registration number
                    within a further 48 hours please re-register.
                    <br><br>
                    If you are unable to register online please send an SAE to: Glastonbury Registration, PO Box 4288,
                    Shepton Mallet, BA4 9BB, to receive a postal registration form. Postal registrations will be
                    confirmed within 14 working days of receipt. If you haven‚Äôt received a registration number within
                    this period, please contact the Festival Office.
                    <br>
                    Your chance of buying tickets is not influenced in any way by the number of times you register, or
                    the information you provide during registration. Registration does not reserve or guarantee you a
                    ticket.
