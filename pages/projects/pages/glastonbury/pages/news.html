                <h2>NEW POETRY FROM THIS YEAR'S OFFICIAL POET SALLY JENKINSON</h2>

                <p class="info-p">
                    <strong>‚ú®WHO AM I THIS YEAR?‚ú®</strong> At twenty years old, with a grief-heavy heart that refused to
                    mend, I was dragged into the fields by golden friends. Amy sang all of her pain and she sang mine
                    too. The rain trickled inside my poncho and mud squelched between my toes. I saw all the humans
                    dancing under the damp hue of a grey Avalon sky. Their bodies sparked like quartz against the cold
                    of my bone and began a small fire.
                    We'd like to thank our Glastonbury Poet in Residence for 2024, Sally Jenkinson, a writer, performer,
                    care worker, and mum from Doncaster, South Yorkshire. Sally Jenkinson's recent chapbook 'Pantomime
                    Horse, Russian Doll, Egg', published by Burning Eye Books, is a poetry cycle exploring labour and
                    childbirth. Her work has also recently been featured in Lighthouse Journal, Emerge Literary Journal,
                    The Morning Star, and on BBC Radio 4's 'Power Lines'. She now lives in the Forest of Dean with her
                    cats, husband, and various fierce and magical children. Sally Jenkinson performed in the Poetry and
                    Words Tent, Theatre & Circus, on Sunday at 4.17pm. Below are Sally Jenkinson's wonderful poems,
                    which perfectly capture the essence of the Festival.
