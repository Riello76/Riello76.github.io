# Glastonbury Festival Website Clone

## Description

This is the final project of the bootcamp with GetSetUK. The project involves recreating the Glastonbury Festival website with some customizations. For example, I added an iframe of their YouTube channel on the homepage, removed three buttons that I deemed unnecessary, and modified the page layout.

## Key Features

- **YouTube Channel Iframe:** An iframe has been embedded in the homepage to display the latest videos from the Glastonbury Festival YouTube channel.
- **Button Removal:** Two buttons have been removed from the footer and the "History" button from the homepage has been moved to the "Gallery" page.
- **New Logo and Buttons:** A new logo and new buttons have been created using Inkscape. All files are in optimized SVG format.
- **Image Conversion:** Images have been converted to WebP format to improve site performance.
- **SVG Header Background:** The header background has been converted from PNG to SVG.
- **Google Maps Integration:** A Google Maps widget has been added to the website, providing directions and details for reaching the Glastonbury Festival location.

## Tools Used

- **Presentation:** I used PowerPoint to outline the project. [PowerPoint Presentation](https://1drv.ms/p/s!Au7JE-h8a1wggW6q141mUHWzc1pY?e=HDkr7V)
- **Wireframe/Mockup:** I created wireframes and mockups on Figma. [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/design/3VD4pv3AS7awF6AVfI7HR7/Glastonbury-festival?node-id=37-575&t=7E5EMbYa1dPDEEi2-1)
- **Development:** I used VS Code to write the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
